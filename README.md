# Arduino-Boe-Bot-
This is my high school Boe-bot project.

I had the oportunity to work as a high school Intern at Northrop Grumman and this is my first experience with programming.
This project was completed back in junior year of high school so the quality of the code is not incredible. I've decided
to preserve the code just the way it is as a reminder of where I started, that way I have a nice picture of where I want
to go.
